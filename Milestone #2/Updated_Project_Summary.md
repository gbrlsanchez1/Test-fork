<b>*Updated Project Summary*</b>

<b>Proposal:</b>
We will propose methodologies and ideas to be implemented, tested, and interpreted for our final project, determining the key objectives that our project will answer, following an initial analysis of the dataset.

For example, we might explore:

★ What are the features that makes movies popular?

★ Can we predict sentiments of reviews?

★ Can we predict user preferences?

<b>Picking our Dataset</b>

We will be using Rotten Tomatoes' Developer API to gather data for analysis (Available at http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/), which consists of:

-Critic and Audience Scores. Tomatometer and Audience scores for movies.

-Critic Reviews. A sampling of critic reviews for each movie.

<b>Data Exploration and Cleaning:</b>

We will perform the following exploration steps:

❖ Decide on a suitable database to store the data [Complete]

❖ Decide on a computing resource to process the data (AWS, Microsoft Azure, personal computer).

❖ Perform Feature Extraction/Selection (where can you get other features?)

❖ Remove/Clean records with spurious entries (e.g. null values, unmatched titles,
etc)

❖ Visualize popularity of different genres.

❖ Check for any correlations between features.


<b>Implement Baselines + Recommender:</b>

● Decide on the performance metric to evaluate prediction.

● Implement the following technique(s):

○ Simple averaging: Predict user ratings of items based on user and item preferences

○ ContentBased Recommendations: Model user + item attributes and interactions with utility matrix

○ Collaborative Filtering: Recommend items based on similarity measures between users and/or items.

○ Other models such as linear regression
